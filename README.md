# New Year Train by Augy Studios and communities
An open-sourced text file for the countdown to celebrate the new year 2025 for every region worldwide.
JuniperBot and Message Scheduler bot will be used for automation purposes for most of this event.

Since the above methods of message scheduling are too expensive to maintain every year, we have decided to use [Telegram](https://augystudios.t.me) to manage this.

Communities like [Rolling Lounge](https://discord.gg/rolling-lounge-400983101507108874) also celebrate New Year with the New Year Train yearly. Check them out on Discord!
